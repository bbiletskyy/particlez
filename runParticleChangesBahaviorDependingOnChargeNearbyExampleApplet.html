This example demonstrates how to build a particle that changes its behavior depending on the charges present around.

  Imagine given the following particles:<br/>
  o - empty placeholder
  f - floating particle, that jumps to the empty placeholder's position located within 1 distance unit away
  e - charge with value -1 and radius 10
  m - charge with value +4 and radius 0     
  g - simple compound
  q - block compound, that substitutes e, m, and f particles with o
  u - particle that jumps out from compound q
  d - particle that jumps into compound q
  
  We are to create a particle that begins to move when e charges appear in the context.
  
  Such particle would be: g(o, q(g(f, m, u, d, e), o))
