This project is the implementation of the theoretical framework introduced in the following articles:


This project is an attempt to understand the programming language that DNA genetic programs are written in. 
This language is stochastic, and it makes use of the active particles. 
Each particle has a random field associated with it, the language provides the ability to compose complex random fields by assembling the complex particles out of the simple ones.
